**Project Overview**

The `make` utility requires a file, `Makefile`(of `makefile`), which defines set of tasks to be executed.
Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using `make install`.

This folder has the following files:
- 0-Makefile
- 1-Makefile
- 2-Makefile
- 3-Makefile
- 4-Makefile
- 5-island_perimeter.py
