Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte. C language is very efficient in manipulating bits. Its a fundamental technique in computer science and programming that involves manipulating bits within a binary representation of data. In most computer systems, data is stored and processed at the bit level, which is the smallest unit of information.
