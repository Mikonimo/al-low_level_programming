Function pointers are a powerful and somewhat advanced feature in many programming languages, including C and C++. They allow you to treat functions as first-class objects, just like variables. In essence, a gunction pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function rather than a data value. You can then use this pointer to call the functuion indirectly. This provides a lot of flexibility and enables some advanced programming techniques such as callbacks and dynamic function selection.
