The C preprocessor modifies a source code file before handling it over to the compiler. You're most likely used to using the preprocessor to include files directly into other files, or #define connstants, but the preprocessor can also be used to create "inlined" code using macros expanded at compile time and to prevent code from being compiled twice.
There are essentially three uses of the preprocessor--directives, constants, and macros. Directives are commands that tell the preprocessor to skip  part of a file, include another file, or define a constant or macro. Directives always begin with a sharo sign (#) and for readability should be placed flush to the left of thepage. All other uses of the preprocessor involve processing #define'd constants or macros. Typicaly, constants and macros are written in ALL CAPS to indicate they are  special.
